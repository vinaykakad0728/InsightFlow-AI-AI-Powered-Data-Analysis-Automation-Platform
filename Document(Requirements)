# InsightFlow AI Requirements Document

## 1. Application Overview

### 1.1 Application Name
InsightFlow AI\n
### 1.2 Application Description
InsightFlow AI is an advanced all-in-one platform for Data Analytics, Data Science, SQL, Python, Machine Learning, and Data Modeling designed specifically for students and professionals. The platform enables users to upload unlimited datasets, preview and manage them through an intuitive Table View, perform comprehensive data cleaning with dataset selection capabilities, create advanced visualizations including KPI cards, build interactive dashboards with fully resizable charts, and train machine learning models with intelligent recommendations. A key differentiator is the fully functional SQL Editor and Python Editor where any operation performed on a dataset—such as filtering, updating, deleting rows, adding columns, merging datasets, grouping, or transforming values—directly modifies the actual stored data, ensuring all changes reflect across Visualization, ML Studio, Dashboard, and Reports modules. The Data Modeling module supports joining unlimited tables with visual and SQL-based interfaces. Additionally, users can view video tutorials and demonstrations directly within the platform. The application operates without authentication requirements, allowing immediate access to all features.\n
